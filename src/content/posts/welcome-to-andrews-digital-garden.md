Hey there! My name is Andrew and this is my personal website and digital garden. I write about all sorts of stuff here - you'll read about sports, programming, psychology, business, philosophy, and maybe even a little bit of creative fiction writing from time to time. There are no limits, no rules, and no creative judgment on this site!

There is a tad bit of structure going on here so there is a little sense of calm amongst the chaos of my mind - you will often find that this site reflects quite a bit of the same stuff going on in my head. I try to filter some of the stuff I know isn't useful before I post it, but there will be a lot of good ideas, even more ok ones, and there will be mostly bad ones, but that is ok, failure is a good thing here!

Let's briefly break down where you'll find specific things on this digital garden site.

## Home Page

The home page is obviously the first page most people will see if they directly visit the site by clicking a URL or searching in their browser, but it is a pretty minimal and simple layout. I got a lot my inspiration for this project from [Brennan Brown's Enjoyment Work starter template](https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work/), which I highly recommend checking out. I really just like the layout for his template and how easy it makes to showcase content - thanks Brennan!

## About Page

The about page is a brief profile about me, the site's creator, main authoer, editor, etc. You can find links to my social media sites, content sites, and personal sites as well as bit of experience and life history here. I plan to add more things on to this page as time goes on.

## Notes Catalog

The notes catalog is my collection of notes that I share on the digital garden - this is not finalized yet as I am still figuring out if I want a separate wiki solution for this or if I want to include the notes catalog directly on this site - feedback would help here!

## Posts Section

The blog/posts section is where you will find any and all content that I'm working on and have published. For now, I will mainly just add posts that I have added from another text editor or note app or from VS Code, but I will integrate an API that pulls my other posts from Dev.to, Medium, Hashnode, etc.

## Projects Section

My projects section is a place where you can learn more about what I'm working on, have created in the past, and ways you can collaborate with me. This is pretty simple for now, but will be improved over time.

## Links Section

The links section is just a collection of bookmarks, tools, articles, dev blogs, and much more. I love sharing things that I find useful, so hopefully you find them useful too!

## Support Page

The support page is a pretty important page for me to share. You can learn more about me and why I am offering many easy ways for you to contribute to helping me create open source software, content, and other creative endeavors that I am working on. Any and all support is greatly appreciated - I couldn't do it without y'all!

## Conclusion

Well, there isn't too much else to go over at the moment as the site is still pretty basic and there is a lot to get done, but I hope this brief post gave you a good idea of what is going on here at this moment.

Thanks for stopping by and check back for more content and site updates in the future!
