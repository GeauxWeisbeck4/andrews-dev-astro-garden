Introduction

This document defines a format for representing markdown as an abstract syntax tree. Development of mdast started in July 2014, in remark, before unist existed. This specification is written in a Web IDL-like grammar.
Where this specification fits

mdast extends unist, a format for syntax trees, to benefit from its ecosystem of utilities.

mdast relates to JavaScript in that it has a rich ecosystem of utilities for working with compliant syntax trees in JavaScript. However, mdast is not limited to JavaScript and can be used in other programming languages.

mdast relates to the unified and remark projects in that mdast syntax trees are used throughout their ecosystems.
Types

If you are using TypeScript, you can use the unist types by installing them with npm:

npm install @types/mdast

Nodes (abstract)
Literal

interface Literal <: UnistLiteral {
  value: string
}

Literal (UnistLiteral) represents an abstract interface in mdast containing a value.

Its value field is a string.
Parent

interface Parent <: UnistParent {
  children: [MdastContent]
}

Parent (UnistParent) represents an abstract interface in mdast containing other nodes (said to be children).

Its content is limited to only other mdast content.
Nodes
Blockquote

interface Blockquote <: Parent {
  type: 'blockquote'
  children: [FlowContent]
}

Blockquote (Parent) represents a section quoted from somewhere else.

Blockquote can be used where flow content is expected. Its content model is also flow content.

For example, the following markdown:

> Alpha bravo charlie.

Yields:

{
  type: 'blockquote',
  children: [{
    type: 'paragraph',
    children: [{type: 'text', value: 'Alpha bravo charlie.'}]
  }]
}

Break

interface Break <: Node {
  type: 'break'
}

Break (Node) represents a line break, such as in poems or addresses.

Break can be used where phrasing content is expected. It has no content model.

For example, the following markdown:

foo··
bar

Yields:

{
  type: 'paragraph',
  children: [
    {type: 'text', value: 'foo'},
    {type: 'break'},
    {type: 'text', value: 'bar'}
  ]
}

Code

interface Code <: Literal {
  type: 'code'
  lang: string?
  meta: string?
}

Code (Literal) represents a block of preformatted text, such as ASCII art or computer code.

Code can be used where flow content is expected. Its content is represented by its value field.

This node relates to the phrasing content concept InlineCode.

A lang field can be present. It represents the language of computer code being marked up.

If the lang field is present, a meta field can be present. It represents custom information relating to the node.

For example, the following markdown:

    foo()

Yields:

{
  type: 'code',
  lang: null,
  meta: null,
  value: 'foo()'
}

And the following markdown:

```js highlight-line="2"
foo()
bar()
baz()
```

Yields:

{
  type: 'code',
  lang: 'javascript',
  meta: 'highlight-line="2"',
  value: 'foo()\nbar()\nbaz()'
}

Definition

interface Definition <: Node {
  type: 'definition'
}

Definition includes Association
Definition includes Resource

Definition (Node) represents a resource.

For example, the following markdown:

[Alpha]: https://example.com

Yields:

{
  type: 'definition',
  identifier: 'alpha',
  label: 'Alpha',
  url: 'https://example.com',
  title: null
}

Emphasis

interface Emphasis <: Parent {
  type: 'emphasis'
  children: [PhrasingContent]
}

Emphasis (Parent) represents stress emphasis of its contents.

Emphasis can be used where phrasing content is expected. Its content model is phrasing content.

For example, the following markdown:

*alpha* _bravo_

Yields:

{
  type: 'paragraph',
  children: [
    {
      type: 'emphasis',
      children: [{type: 'text', value: 'alpha'}]
    },
    {type: 'text', value: ' '},
    {
      type: 'emphasis',
      children: [{type: 'text', value: 'bravo'}]
    }
  ]
}

Heading

interface Heading <: Parent {
  type: 'heading'
  depth: 1 <= number <= 6
  children: [PhrasingContent]
}

Heading (Parent) represents a heading of a section.

Heading can be used where flow content is expected. Its content model is phrasing content.

A depth field must be present. A value of 1 is said to be the highest rank and 6 the lowest.

For example, the following markdown:

# Alpha

Yields:

{
  type: 'heading',
  depth: 1,
  children: [{type: 'text', value: 'Alpha'}]
}

Html

interface Html <: Literal {
  type: 'html'
}

Html (Literal) represents a fragment of raw HTML.

Html can be used where flow or phrasing content is expected. Its content is represented by its value field.

Html nodes do not have the restriction of being valid or complete HTML ([HTML]) constructs.

For example, the following markdown:

<div>

Yields:

{type: 'html', value: '<div>'}

Image

interface Image <: Node {
  type: 'image'
}

Image includes Resource
Image includes Alternative

Image (Node) represents an image.

Image includes the mixins Resource and Alternative.

For example, the following markdown:

![alpha](https://example.com/favicon.ico "bravo")

Yields:

{
  type: 'image',
  url: 'https://example.com/favicon.ico',
  title: 'bravo',
  alt: 'alpha'
}

ImageReference

interface ImageReference <: Node {
  type: 'imageReference'
}

ImageReference includes Reference

  spread: boolean?
  children: [ListContent]
}

List (Parent) represents a list of items.

List can be used where flow content is expected. Its content model is list content.

An ordered field can be present. It represents that the items have been intentionally ordered (when true), or that the order of items is not important (when false or not present).

A start field can be present. It represents, when the ordered field is true, the starting number of the list.

A spread field can be present. It represents that one or more of its children are separated with a blank line from its siblings (when true), or not (when false or not present).

For example, the following markdown:

1. foo

Yields:

{
  type: 'list',
  ordered: true,
  start: 1,
  spread: false,
  children: [{
    type: 'listItem',

  type: 'listItem'
  spread: boolean?
  children: [FlowContent]
}

ListItem (Parent) represents an item in a List.

ListItem can be used where list content is expected. Its content model is flow content.

  children: [{type: 'text', value: 'Alpha bravo charlie.'}]
}

Root

interface Root <: Parent {
  type: 'root'
}

Root (Parent) represents a document.

Root can be used as the root of a tree, never as a child. Its content model is not limited to flow content, but instead can contain any mdast content with the restriction that all content must be of the same category.
Strong

interface Strong <: Parent {
  type: 'strong'
  children: [PhrasingContent]
}

Strong (Parent) represents strong importance, seriousness, or urgency for its contents.

Strong can be used where phrasing content is expected. Its content model is phrasing content.

For example, the following markdown:

**alpha** __bravo__

Yields:

{
  type: 'paragraph',

  ]
}

Text

interface Text <: Literal {

}

ThematicBreak (Node) represents a thematic break, such as a scene change in a story, a transition to another topic, or a new document.

ThematicBreak can be used where flow content is expected. It has no content model.

For example, the following markdown:

***

Yields:

{type: 'thematicBreak'}

Mixin
Alternative

interface mixin Alternative {
  alt: string?
}

Alternative represents a node with a fallback

An alt field should be present. It represents equivalent content for environments that cannot represent the node as intended.
Association

interface mixin Association {
  identifier: string
  label: string?
}

Association represents an internal relation from one node to another.

An identifier field must be present. It can match another node. identifier is a source value: character escapes and character references are not parsed. Its value must be normalized.

A label field can be present. label is a string value: it works just like title on a link or a lang on code: character escapes and character references are parsed.

To normalize a value, collapse markdown whitespace ([\t\n\r ]+) to a space, trim the optional initial and/or final space, and perform case-folding.

Whether the value of identifier (or normalized label if there is no identifier) is expected to be a unique identifier or not depends on the type of node including the Association. An example of this is that they should be unique on Definition, whereas multiple LinkReferences can be non-unique to be associated with one definition.
Reference

interface mixin Reference {
  referenceType: string
}

Reference includes Association

Reference represents a marker that is associated to another node.

A referenceType field must be present. Its value must be a referenceType. It represents the explicitness of the reference.
Resource

interface mixin Resource {
  url: string
  title: string?
}

Resource represents a reference to resource.

A url field must be present. It represents a URL to the referenced resource.

A title field can be present. It represents advisory information for the resource, such as would be appropriate for a tooltip.
Enumeration
referenceType

enum referenceType {
  'shortcut' | 'collapsed' | 'full'
}

referenceType represents the explicitness of a reference.

    shortcut: the reference is implicit, its identifier inferred from its content
    collapsed: the reference is explicit, its identifier inferred from its content
    full: the reference is explicit, its identifier explicitly set

Content model

type MdastContent = FlowContent | ListContent | PhrasingContent

Each node in mdast falls into one or more categories of Content that group nodes with similar characteristics together.
Content

type Content = Definition | Paragraph

Content represents runs of text that form definitions and paragraphs.
FlowContent

type FlowContent =
  Blockquote | Code | Heading | Html | List | ThematicBreak | Content

Flow content represent the sections of document.
ListContent

type ListContent = ListItem

List content represent the items in a list.
PhrasingContent

type PhrasingContent = Break | Emphasis | Html | Image | ImageReference
  | InlineCode | Link | LinkReference | Strong | Text

Phrasing content represent the text in a document and its markup.

Security

As mdast can contain HTML and be used to represent HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, improper use of mdast is also unsafe. When transforming to HTML (typically through hast), always be careful with user input and use hast-util-santize to make the hast tree safe.
