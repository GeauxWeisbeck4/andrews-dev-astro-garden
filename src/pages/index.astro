				Welcome to the digital garden of Andrew Weisbeck, WeisGarden! This
				website was inspired by one of my favorite themes, Enjoyment Work by
				Brennan Brown. You will notice many similar styling, structure, and
				layout aspects of that theme here, so I must give a lot of credit to
				Brennan because he is the one who thought of this design, thanks!

				This is a place for me to collect my thoughts, notes, ideas, and more â€”
				my own corner of the internet to share with the world. I hope you find
				something useful or interesting here! Here are some things you might
				want to check out if you aren't sure where to start:

						My collection of notes, organized into categories like computer
						science, psychology, and statistics. Notes on anything and
						everything - read about the original cynicism philosopher Diogenes
						on one page and then read about Bayesian statistics on another.
						There should be something for everybody here.

						Daily posts that include random thoughts, ideas, interesting free
						write sessions that I feel like sharing, and many of life's

						This will be sort of an experimental feature you could say - well, the sprints section at least. I used this starter project from the 11ty community that was basically a personal agile website theme that I really liked and I've always wanted to implement that into my own site/digital garden, so this is testing that out! You'll just have to visit that section to see how it works!

			<p>I've been trying to get my digital garden site up and shared publically, but I always sputter out when it comes to picking a design I like, because I am honestly never satisfied enough with anything. The Enjoyment Work theme is about as close to satisfaction as I'll probably ever get, so I'm implementing that as the solution and building on top of it, extending it to meet my needs while doing the things a digital garden needs to do.</p>
